## Data type

* Nominal data: a type of qualitative data that is categorized without a set order, e.g. yes/ no/ not sure
* Ordinal data: a type of qualitative data with a set order or scale, e.g. rank 1-5

## Data transformation usually involves:

* Adding, copying, or replicating data
* Deleting fields or records 
* Standardizing the names of variables
* Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database
* Joining one set of data with another
* Saving a file in a different format. For example, saving a spreadsheet as a comma separated values (CSV) file.

## Data ethics

* Ownership: individuals own the raw data they provide and they have primary control over its usage
* Transcation transparency: all data-processsing activities and algorithms should be completely explainable and understood by individual who provides data
* Consent: an individual's right to know how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it
* Currency: individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of transactions
* Privacy: preserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs (access, use, collection of data)
* Openness: free access, usage, and sharing of data

## Keys in database

## Data collection

First-party data: data colleccted by an individual or group using their own resources

Second-party data: collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold

Third-party data: collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly

## Sample size

* Don't use a sample size less than 30. It has been statistically proven that 30 is the smallest sample size where an average result of a sample starts to represent the average result of a population.

* The confidence level most commonly used is 95%, but 90% can work in some cases. 

## Statistical significance

The determination of whether your result could be due to random chance or not. The greater the significance, the less due to chance.

## Confidence interval

The range of possible values that the population’s result would be at the confidence level of the study. This range is the sample result +/- the margin of error.

## Data mapping

The process of matching fields from one data source to another. e.g. China <--> CN

## Subquery

A SQL query that is nested inside a larger query. Inner most query excute first.

Common to see in FROM and WHERE statements.
