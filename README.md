## Data analytic project

[Cyclistic bike-share analysis](https://github.com/siyue-zhang/google-data-analytics-cert/blob/master/capstone%20project/README.md)

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

The public data for Divvy Bikes has been made available by Motivate International Inc under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). To preserve the data privacy, the customer data is not provided in this trip dataset. This means that it's possible to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

This project aims to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, so that the company could make effective markerting strategies and campaigns to convert casual riders to annual memberships.

## Data type

* Nominal data: a type of qualitative data that is categorized without a set order, e.g. yes/ no/ not sure
* Ordinal data: a type of qualitative data with a set order or scale, e.g. rank 1-5

## Data transformation usually involves:

* Adding, copying, or replicating data
* Deleting fields or records 
* Standardizing the names of variables
* Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database
* Joining one set of data with another
* Saving a file in a different format. For example, saving a spreadsheet as a comma separated values (CSV) file.

## Data ethics

* Ownership: individuals own the raw data they provide and they have primary control over its usage
* Transcation transparency: all data-processsing activities and algorithms should be completely explainable and understood by individual who provides data
* Consent: an individual's right to know how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it
* Currency: individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of transactions
* Privacy: preserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs (access, use, collection of data)
* Openness: free access, usage, and sharing of data

## Keys in database

Primary key: unique identifier in the table

Foreign key: a field within a table that is a primary key in another table

## Data collection

First-party data: data colleccted by an individual or group using their own resources

Second-party data: collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold

Third-party data: collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly

## Sample size

* Don't use a sample size less than 30. It has been statistically proven that 30 is the smallest sample size where an average result of a sample starts to represent the average result of a population.

* The confidence level most commonly used is 95%, but 90% can work in some cases. 

## Statistical significance

The determination of whether your result could be due to random chance or not. The greater the significance, the less due to chance.

## Confidence interval

The range of possible values that the population’s result would be at the confidence level of the study. This range is the sample result +/- the margin of error.

## Data mapping

The process of matching fields from one data source to another. e.g. China <--> CN

## Subquery

A SQL query that is nested inside a larger query. Inner most query excute first.

Common to see in FROM and WHERE statements.

* Current
* Cited
